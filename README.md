# MariaDB Docker Image With Alpine Linux

Lightweight MariaDB docker image based on Alpine Linux.

__Primary Goal:__ Fully compatible with [official MariaDB image](https://hub.docker.com/_/mariadb/) (based on Debian).

## Versions

For simplicity and ease of maintenance, this image is based on [alpine:latest](https://hub.docker.com/_/alpine/) docker image and latest MariaDB package from [official Alpine repositories](https://pkgs.alpinelinux.org/packages).

I'll trigger a rebuild whenever [alpine:latest](https://hub.docker.com/_/alpine/) docker image or MariaDB package is updated.

## Features

Almost the same as [official MariaDB image](https://hub.docker.com/_/mariadb/).

## Usage

See [official MariaDB image](https://hub.docker.com/_/mariadb/).
